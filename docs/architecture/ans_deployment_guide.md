# ANS Deployment and Reliability Guide

This document provides specific guidance for deploying the Agent Name Service (ANS) in production environments, focusing on reliability, scalability, and security considerations.

## 1. Deployment Strategies

### 1.1 Environment Tiers

| Environment | Purpose | Scaling | Database |
|-------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Development | Local development and testing | Single instance | SQLite |
| Staging | Integration testing and pre-production validation | Limited horizontal scaling | SQLite (single node) |
| Production | Production workloads | Full horizontal scaling | PostgreSQL (for high-volume deployments) |

### 1.2 Containerization Strategy

The ANS system is designed to be containerized using Docker:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Container Components"
        A[API Gateway Container]
        B[Registration Service Container]
        C[Resolution Service Container]
        D[Certificate Service Container]
        E[Threat Service Container]
    end
    
    subgraph "Persistent Storage"
        F[Database Volume]
        G[Certificate Store Volume]
        H[Configuration Volume]
    end
    
    A --> B
    A --> C
    A --> D
    A --> E
    
    B --> F
    C --> F
    D --> F
    D --> G
    E --> F
    
    A --> H
    B --> H
    C --> H
    D --> H
    E --> H
```

### 1.3 Container Orchestration

For production deployments, Kubernetes is recommended with the following resource configuration:

| Component | CPU Request | Memory Request | CPU Limit | Memory Limit |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| API Gateway | 0.5 | 512Mi | 1.0 | 1Gi |
| Registration Service | 0.5 | 512Mi | 1.0 | 1Gi |
| Resolution Service | 1.0 | 1Gi | 2.0 | 2Gi |
| Certificate Service | 0.5 | 512Mi | 1.0 | 1Gi |
| Threat Service | 0.5 | 512Mi | 1.0 | 1Gi |
| Database (SQLite) | 0.5 | 1Gi | 1.0 | 2Gi |
| Database (PostgreSQL) | 2.0 | 4Gi | 4.0 | 8Gi |

## 2. Reliability Strategies

### 2.1 High Availability Configuration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Region A"
        LB_A[Load Balancer A]
        A1[ANS Node A1]
        A2[ANS Node A2]
        DB_A[Database A]
    end
    
    subgraph "Region B"
        LB_B[Load Balancer B]
        B1[ANS Node B1]
        B2[ANS Node B2]
        DB_B[Database B]
    end
    
    LB_A --> A1
    LB_A --> A2
    A1 --> DB_A
    A2 --> DB_A
    
    LB_B --> B1
    LB_B --> B2
    B1 --> DB_B
    B2 --> DB_B
    
    DB_A <--> DB_B
    LB_A <--> LB_B
```

### 2.2 Failure Modes and Handling

| Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------|--------|---------------------|
| Single node failure | Reduced capacity | Auto-scaling, health checks, node replacement |
| Database failure | Data access disruption | Database replication, failover mechanisms |
| Network partition | Service isolation | Multi-region deployment, circuit breakers |
| Certificate service failure | Auth disruption | Certificate caching, fallback validation |
| External API failures | Limited functionality | Circuit breakers, graceful degradation |

### 2.3 Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

| Service Component | RPO | RTO |
|-------------------|-----|-----|
| Agent registration data | < 5 minutes | < 10 minutes |
| Certificate data | < 1 minute | < 5 minutes |
| Security events | < 15 minutes | < 30 minutes |

## 3. Scalability Implementation

### 3.1 Horizontal Scaling Approach

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Gateway Tier"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        G1[Gateway 1]
        G2[Gateway 2]
        G3[Gateway 3]
    end
    
    subgraph "Service Tier"
        S1[Service Pod 1]
        S2[Service Pod 2]
        S3[Service Pod 3]
        S4[Service Pod 4]
        S5[Service Pod 5]
        S6[Service Pod 6]
    end
    
    subgraph "Database Tier"
        M[Master DB]
        R1[Replica 1]
        R2[Replica 2]
    end
    
    LB --> G1
    LB --> G2
    LB --> G3
    
    G1 --> S1
    G1 --> S2
    G2 --> S3
    G2 --> S4
    G3 --> S5
    G3 --> S6
    
    S1 --> M
    S2 --> M
    S3 --> M
    S4 --> M
    S5 --> M
    S6 --> M
    
    S1 --> R1
    S2 --> R1
    S3 --> R1
    S4 --> R2
    S5 --> R2
    S6 --> R2
    
    M --> R1
    M --> R2
```

### 3.2 Auto-scaling Rules

| Component | Scale Out Trigger | Scale In Trigger | Min Instances | Max Instances |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| API Gateway | CPU > 70% for 2m | CPU < 30% for 10m | 2 | 10 |
| Registration Service | Queue depth > 100 | Queue depth < 10 for 10m | 2 | 8 |
| Resolution Service | CPU > 60% for 2m | CPU < 30% for 10m | 3 | 12 |
| Certificate Service | CPU > 60% for 2m | CPU < 30% for 10m | 2 | 8 |
| Threat Service | CPU > 60% for 2m | CPU < 30% for 10m | 2 | 6 |

### 3.3 Resource Scaling Strategy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Monitor system metrics] --> B{CPU > Threshold?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Increase pod count]
    B -->|No| D{CPU < Lower Threshold?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Decrease pod count]
    D -->|No| F[Maintain current pods]
    
    C --> G[Wait cooldown period]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> A
```

## 4. Database Scaling

### 4.1 Development to Production Migration

For production workloads exceeding the capacity of SQLite, migration to PostgreSQL is recommended:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SQLite Database] --> B[Export Schema]
    A --> C[Export Data]
    
    B --> D[Convert Schema to PostgreSQL]
    C --> E[Transform Data]
    
    D --> F[Create PostgreSQL Schema]
    E --> G[Import Data to PostgreSQL]
    
    F --> G
    G --> H[Verify Data Integrity]
    H --> I[Update Connection Configuration]
    I --> J[Switch to PostgreSQL Database]
```

### 4.2 Read/Write Split Strategy

For high-volume deployments, implement read/write splitting:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B{Read or Write?}
    
    B -->|Read| C[Load Balancer for Read Replicas]
    B -->|Write| D[Master Database]
    
    C --> E[Read Replica 1]
    C --> F[Read Replica 2]
    C --> G[Read Replica 3]
    
    D --> H[Replication Process]
    H --> E
    H --> F
    H --> G
```

## 5. Security Hardening for Production

### 5.1 Certificate Management

For production environments, integrate with external certificate authorities:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "ANS System"
        A[Certificate Service]
        B[Certificate Store]
    end
    
    subgraph "External CA"
        C[Certificate Authority]
        D[OCSP Responder]
        E[CRL Distribution Point]
    end
    
    A --> C
    A --> D
    A --> E
    C --> B
```

### 5.2 Network Security Implementation

| Zone | Components | Inbound Access | Outbound Access |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Public | API Gateway | HTTPS (443) | Internal services only |
| Service | Core Services | API Gateway only | Database, External APIs |
| Data | Database | Service layer only | None |
| Management | Admin Tools | VPN/Bastion only | Monitoring systems |

### 5.3 Security Scanning Integration

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "CI/CD Pipeline"
        A[Code Commit]
        B[Build]
        C[Unit Tests]
        D[Security Scan]
        E[Deploy to Staging]
        F[Integration Tests]
        G[Deploy to Production]
    end
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    
    subgraph "Security Scans"
        H[Static Analysis]
        I[Dependency Check]
        J[Container Scan]
        K[Dynamic Analysis]
    end
    
    D --> H
    D --> I
    D --> J
    E --> K
```

## 6. Monitoring Implementation

### 6.1 Metrics Collection

| Component | Key Metrics | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| API Gateway | Request rate, Error rate, Latency | >100 req/s, >1% errors, >100ms | >500 req/s, >5% errors, >250ms |
| Registration Service | Request rate, Processing time | >20 req/s, >200ms | >50 req/s, >500ms |
| Resolution Service | Request rate, Lookup time | >200 req/s, >50ms | >500 req/s, >100ms |
| Certificate Service | Validation rate, Issuance time | >50 req/s, >300ms | >100 req/s, >700ms |
| Database | Connections, Query time, Size | >50 conn, >50ms, >80% capacity | >100 conn, >100ms, >90% capacity |

### 6.2 Log Aggregation

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Application Components"
        A[API Gateway]
        B[Core Services]
        C[Database]
    end
    
    subgraph "Log Pipeline"
        D[Log Collectors]
        E[Log Processor]
        F[Log Storage]
        G[Log Analytics]
        H[Alerting]
    end
    
    A --> D
    B --> D
    C --> D
    
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
```

### 6.3 Health Check Implementation

| Endpoint | Check Type | Frequency | Timeout | Failure Threshold |
|----------|------------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| `/health/liveness` | HTTP GET | 10s | 2s | 3 failures |
| `/health/readiness` | HTTP GET | 30s | 5s | 2 failures |
| `/health/startup` | HTTP GET | 5s | 10s | 12 failures |
| `/health/database` | HTTP GET | 60s | 5s | 2 failures |
| `/health/certificate` | HTTP GET | 60s | 5s | 2 failures |

## 7. Disaster Recovery Plan

### 7.1 Backup Strategy

| Data Category | Backup Frequency | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Database | Hourly | 7 days | Primary + Secondary region |
| Certificate store | Daily | 90 days | Primary + Secondary region + Cold storage |
| Configuration | After changes | 365 days | Version control + Secondary region |
| Logs | Real-time | 30 days | Primary region + Archive |

### 7.2 Recovery Procedure

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Disaster Detected] --> B{Severity Assessment}
    
    B -->|Minor| C[Service Restart]
    B -->|Moderate| D[Region Failover]
    B -->|Severe| E[Full Restoration]
    
    C --> F[Verify Service Health]
    D --> F
    
    E --> G[Restore from Backups]
    G --> H[Verify Data Integrity]
    H --> I[Restore Service Configuration]
    I --> J[Gradual Traffic Restoration]
    J --> F
    
    F --> K[Post-Incident Review]
```

## 8. Performance Optimization

### 8.1 Database Optimization

| Strategy | Implementation | Expected Impact |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Index optimization | Create indexes for common query patterns | 50-80% query time reduction |
| Connection pooling | Implement with 10-20 max connections per service | Reduced connection overhead |
| Query optimization | Rewrite complex queries using query analyzer results | 30-60% query time reduction |
| Denormalization | Create read-optimized views for resolution queries | 40-70% read time reduction |

### 8.2 Caching Strategy

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B{Cached?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Return Cached Result]
    B -->|No| D[Process Request]
    D --> E[Store in Cache]
    E --> F[Return Result]
    C --> G[Client]
    F --> G
```

| Cache Type | Data Category | TTL | Invalidation Strategy |
|------------|---------------|-----|------------------------|
| In-memory | Resolution results | 60s | Time-based + explicit on update |
| Redis | Certificate validation | 5m | Time-based + explicit on status change |
| Local | Configuration | 5m | Configuration change events |
| CDN | Public certificates | 15m | Time-based + explicit on revocation |
