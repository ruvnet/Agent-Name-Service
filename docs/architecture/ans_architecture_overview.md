# Agent Name Service (ANS) Architecture Overview

## Introduction

The Agent Name Service (ANS) provides a critical infrastructure component enabling communication and discovery between autonomous agents and Management Control Panel (MCP) servers. This document serves as the main entry point to understand the ANS architecture and how the different architectural components fit together.

## Architecture Document Structure

The ANS architecture is documented across several specialized documents:

1. [**Main Architecture Document**](ans_architecture.md) - Core system design, components, and data flows
2. [**Deployment Guide**](ans_deployment_guide.md) - Deployment strategies and reliability considerations
3. [**Security Architecture**](ans_security_architecture.md) - Security design, certificate handling, and threat modeling

```

## Key System Features

The ANS architecture implements the following key features:

### 1. Agent Registration and Identity

- Unique identifier allocation and management
- Certificate-based identity verification
- Metadata and capability declaration
- Lifecycle management (creation, updates, expiration)

### 2. Agent Resolution and Discovery

- Lookup by identifier or name
- Capability-based discovery
- Cryptographic identity verification
- Filtering and access controls

### 3. Certificate Infrastructure

- X.509 certificate generation and validation
- Certificate lifecycle management
- Trust chain validation
- Revocation support

### 4. Security and Threat Management

- Integration with Mastra.ai threat modeling
- Adaptive security controls
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### 5. MCP Integration

- Privileged access for MCP servers
- Bulk operations support
- Enhanced administrative capabilities
- Delegated agent management

## Core Design Principles

### Modularity

The ANS architecture follows a modular design with clearly separated components:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[API Gateway] --> B[Core Services]
    B --> C[Database Layer]
    
    subgraph "Core Services"
        D[Registration Service]
        E[Resolution Service]
        F[Certificate Service]
        G[Threat Service]
    end
    
    B -.-> D
    B -.-> E
    B -.-> F
    B -.-> G
    
    classDef gateway fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef services fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef database fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class A gateway;
    class B,D,E,F,G services;
    class C database;
```

Each component has:
- Well-defined responsibilities
- Clear interfaces
- Isolated implementation details
- Independent scalability

### Security by Design

Security is integrated into every aspect of the ANS architecture:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Authentication/Authorization] --> B[Core Services]
    C[Certificate Management] --> B
    D[Threat Detection] --> B
    E[Secure Communication] --> B
    F[Data Protection] --> B
    
    classDef security fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef services fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class A,C,D,E,F security;
    class B services;
```

Security features include:
- Certificate-based authentication
- TLS for all communications
- Comprehensive access controls
- Threat detection and mitigation
- Secure development practices

### Scalability

The architecture is designed for horizontal scaling:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Load Balancer] --> B[API Gateway Cluster]
    B --> C[Service Cluster]
    C --> D[Database Cluster]
    
    classDef infra fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef services fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    classDef data fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px;
    
    class A,B infra;
    class C services;
    class D data;
```

Scalability features include:
- Stateless service design
- Horizontal scaling of components
- Caching for read-heavy workloads
- Database optimizations
- Efficient resource utilization

## Key Workflows

### Agent Registration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Reg as Registration Service
    participant Cert as Certificate Service
    participant DB
    
    Agent->>API: Registration Request
    API->>Reg: Forward Request
    Reg->>Cert: Request Certificate
    Cert->>Cert: Generate Certificate
    Cert->>Reg: Return Certificate
    Reg->>DB: Store Agent Record
    Reg->>API: Registration Response
    API->>Agent: Return Response
```

### Agent Resolution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant API as API Gateway
    participant Res as Resolution Service
    participant DB
    
    Agent->>API: Resolution Request
    API->>Res: Forward Request
    Res->>DB: Query Agent Records
    DB->>Res: Return Results
    Res->>Res: Apply Filters
    Res->>API: Resolution Response
    API->>Agent: Return Response
```

## Implementation Considerations

### Database Schema

The core database schema encompasses these main entities:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    AGENTS ||--o{ ENDPOINTS : contains
    AGENTS ||--o{ AGENT_CAPABILITIES : has
    AGENTS }|--|| CERTIFICATES : uses
    
    CAPABILITIES ||--o{ AGENT_CAPABILITIES : associated_with
    
    SECURITY_EVENTS ||--o{ SECURITY_EVENT_METADATA : has
```

### API Contract

The ANS exposes the following primary API endpoints:

| Area | Key Endpoints | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Registration | `/v1/agents` | Agent registration and management |
| Resolution | `/v1/resolve` | Agent discovery and lookup |
| Certificates | `/v1/certificates` | Certificate management |
| Security | `/v1/security` | Security operations and reporting |
| MCP | `/v1/mcp` | MCP-specific operations |
