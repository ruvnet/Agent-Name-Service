# Agent Name Service Workflows

## Overview

The Agent Name Service (ANS) provides a comprehensive set of workflows for agent lifecycle management, security, discovery, and interoperability. These workflows standardize critical processes, ensuring consistency, security, and proper integration across the agent ecosystem.

## Core Workflows

| ID | Workflow | Description | Primary Use Cases |
|----|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| 01 | [Agent Registration](./01_agent_registration_workflow.md) | Registers new agents with the ANS system | • Onboarding new agents<br>• Initial certificate issuance<br>• Security validation |
| 02 | [Certificate Rotation](./02_certificate_rotation_workflow.md) | Manages rotation and renewal of agent certificates | • Certificate expiration<br>• Security upgrades<br>• Key compromise recovery |
| 03 | [Agent Resolution](./03_agent_resolution_workflow.md) | Resolves agent identifiers to their complete data | • Agent discovery<br>• Certificate verification<br>• Capability inspection |
| 04 | [Security Monitoring](./04_security_monitoring_workflow.md) | Monitors agent security status and behavior | • Threat detection<br>• Anomaly identification<br>• Security baseline management |
| 05 | [Protocol Translation](./05_protocol_translation_workflow.md) | Translates between different agent protocols | • Cross-protocol communication<br>• Legacy system integration<br>• Standard compliance |
| 06 | [Capability Discovery](./06_agent_capability_discovery_workflow.md) | Discovers and catalogs agent capabilities | • Service discovery<br>• Integration planning<br>• Capability mapping |

## Workflow Architecture

ANS workflows are designed with the following architectural principles:

1. **Modularity** - Each workflow focuses on a specific concern and can be used independently
2. **Composability** - Workflows can be combined and chained to handle complex operations
3. **Transactionality** - Critical operations maintain data consistency even during failures
4. **Observability** - All workflow steps emit detailed telemetry for monitoring and debugging
5. **Security-First** - Security validations are integral to every workflow
6. **Idempotency** - Workflows can be safely retried without causing duplicate effects

## Workflow Components

Each workflow consists of the following standard components:

- **Trigger Schema** - Defines the input parameters and validation rules
- **Steps** - Discrete processing units with clear input/output contracts
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management and recovery strategies
- **Integration Points** - Defined interfaces with external systems and services
- **Instrumentation** - Performance monitoring and operational metrics

## Integration Patterns

ANS workflows support the following integration patterns:

1. **Synchronous Request/Response** - Direct workflow invocation with immediate results
2. **Asynchronous Processing** - Long-running operations with eventual completion
3. **Event-Driven Triggers** - Workflows initiated by system events
4. **Scheduled Execution** - Periodic workflow execution for maintenance operations
5. **Chained Workflows** - Sequential execution of multiple workflows

## Technical Implementation

ANS workflows are implemented using the Mastra workflow engine, providing:

- Type-safe workflow definitions using Zod for schema validation
- Step-based execution with clear boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Logging and telemetry at each step
- Separation of workflow logic from implementation details

### Execution Environment

Workflows execute in a managed environment with:

- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Concurrency management and rate limiting
- Resource allocation based on workflow priority
- Audit logging for all critical operations

## Security Considerations

Workflow security is maintained through:

1. **Authentication** - All workflow triggers require proper authentication
2. **Authorization** - Permissions are verified for each workflow operation
3. **Validation** - Input validation prevents injection and other attacks
4. **Rate Limiting** - Protection against abuse and denial of service
5. **Sensitive Data Handling** - Proper management of security-sensitive information
6. **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events

## Workflow Development

To develop or modify ANS workflows:

1. Review the existing workflow documentation to understand current functionality
2. Identify the specific workflow requirements and integration points
3. Design the workflow schema and step sequence
4. Implement the workflow using the Mastra workflow framework
5. Create comprehensive tests covering normal and error paths
6. Update documentation to reflect workflow behavior and integration details

## Example: Chaining Workflows

Workflows can be chained together to implement complex processes. For example, a complete agent onboarding process might involve:

```typescript
// Step 1: Register the agent
const registrationResult = await triggerWorkflow('agent-registration-workflow', {
  name: 'new-service-agent',
  metadata: {
    description: 'New service agent for data processing',
    capabilities: ['data.process', 'data.transform']
  }
});

// Step 2: Discover detailed capabilities
const discoveryResult = await triggerWorkflow('capability-discovery-workflow', {
  agentIdentifier: 'new-service-agent',
  discoveryOptions: {
    discoveryMode: 'ACTIVE',
    includeExamples: true
  }
});

// Step 3: Set up security monitoring
const monitoringResult = await triggerWorkflow('security-monitoring-workflow', {
  monitoringTarget: {
    agentName: 'new-service-agent'
  },
  monitoringOptions: {
    monitoringMode: 'ACTIVE',
    analysisLevel: 'ADVANCED'
  }
});
```

## Workflow Status Codes

All workflows return standard status codes indicating the result of the operation:

| Code | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 200 | SUCCESS | Workflow completed successfully |
| 400 | BAD_REQUEST | Invalid input parameters |
| 401 | UNAUTHORIZED | Authentication required |
| 403 | FORBIDDEN | Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | NOT_FOUND | Requested resource not found |
| 409 | CONFLICT | Resource conflict or validation failure |
| 429 | RATE_LIMITED | Request throttled due to rate limiting |
| 500 | SERVER_ERROR | Internal server error |
| 503 | UNAVAILABLE | Service temporarily unavailable |

## Monitoring and Operations

Workflows expose metrics and telemetry for operational monitoring:

- **Invocation Count** - Number of workflow executions
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful completions
- **Duration** - Execution time statistics
- **Error Rate** - Frequency and types of errors
- **Step Metrics** - Performance metrics for individual steps
- **Resource Usage** - CPU, memory, and I/O utilization

## Future Workflow Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the workflow system include:

1. **Agent Migration Workflow** - Facilitating secure agent migration between environments
2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Coordinating operations across multiple agents
3. **Compliance Verification** - Validating agents against regulatory requirements
4. **Disaster Recovery** - Streamlined recovery from catastrophic failures
5. **Performance Optimization** - Automated performance tuning and resource allocation
