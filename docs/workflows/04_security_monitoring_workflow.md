# Security Monitoring Workflow

## Overview

The Security Monitoring Workflow continuously observes the Agent Name Service (ANS) ecosystem to detect, analyze, respond to, and report on security events and anomalies. This workflow includes automatic threat detection, behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, and incident response coordination to maintain the integrity and security of the agent ecosystem. The workflow provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities to identify and mitigate security risks proactively.
